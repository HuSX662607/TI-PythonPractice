# TI-PythonPractice(Still Being Updated)
This repository is a collection of scripts using Python to draw some figures in the Lecture Notes of Physics Vol.919, 'A Short Course on Topological Insulators' written by Jánoth K.Asbóth, et al., in order to practising Python coding as well as learning the physics of topological insulators. 

You are free to give some suggestions to help improve the coding or the arrangement of the repository.
